# Windows Status Monitor

## Why I want to implement it?

I have kind of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder to see the status  of current system like net speed, RAM occupied or fan speed. We did have some softwares like 360 and Tencent PC manager, I think they are to heavy and they will occupy some system resource by themselves, and I don't think they are safety. Then I decided to implement my own Windows Status Monitor. It will be implemented by Qt and C++.
